## Summary

Software Engineer with 10+ years of overall IT experience. For the last 6 years, I've been working as a Software Engineer with key skills in Python, AWS, Terraform, AI, Docker, Jenkins, Linux and Git.

I participated in projects related to the handling of cloud infrastructure, creating microservices, monitoring solutions, and ETL, etc. On my last project at a big media platform, I've been working as a Key Python Developer in a DevOps team. I've developed various infrastructure utilities, APIs and services, from architecture to programming in Python, building cloud infrastructure using Terraform and building CI/CD using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Groovy and Bash.

Lately I've been fascinated by AI, that I use to develop a network of Telegram channels with generated content.

My robust programming skills, coupled with a keen interest in cloud technology and automation, as well as enthusiasm for AI, motivates me to seek a role as a Backend Developer for AI Real Estate Assistant.
