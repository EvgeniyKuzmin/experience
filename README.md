# Evgenii Kuzmin, Senior Software Engineer

I am an Software Engineer with 10+ years of overall IT experience. During my career, I've been able to work in various roles, such as:

- System Administrator
- Cyber Security Specialist
- Database Administrator
- Computer Science Teacher

For the last 6 years, I've been working as a Software Engineer with key skills in Python, AWS, Terraform, AI, Docker, Jenkins, Linux and Git.

I'm most skilled in the design and implementation of cloud-native applications. I believe that Python, cloud technologies and DevOps methodology are the best tools to solve business problems by rapidly delivering high-quality software.

Lately I've been fascinated by AI, that I use to develop a network of Telegram channels with generated entertainment content.

As a big fan of the concept of continuous learning, I always strive to improve the quality of our projects as well as our skills. I think that sharing your knowledge and experience is the same important as studying.

Self-motivated, conflict-free and responsible team player.
