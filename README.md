# Evgenii Kuzmin

I have 5+ years of experience as a Python Developer and 10+ years in the IT sphere, including system administration, web development and education.

I'm most skilled in the design and implementation of cloud-native applications using Python and AWS. I believe that Python, Cloud and DevOps methodology are the best tools to solve business problems by delivering high-quality software faster.

As a big fan of the concept of continuous learning, I always strive to improve the quality of our projects as well as our skills. I think that sharing your knowledge and experience is the same important as well as studying.

Self-motivated, conflict-free and responsible team player.
