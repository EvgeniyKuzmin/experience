## Participation

At the start of the project, my main responsibility was migration of the backend API service (Sope) to a new infrastructure. Then I continued working as a part of DevOps team to deliver Python-based solutions to solve infrastructure issues. I was involved in developing different services, starting from writing Python code to describing infrastructure as a code and building CI/CD. Here is the list of services I was working on:

- **Sope**: server-side web API application for program composition and personalization by applying trained data models
  - *Code*: Python using Pyramid, SQLAlchemy, Alembic and Redis, Gensim, Sklearn
  - *Infrastructure*: CloudWatch Synthetics Canary, EventBridge, Alarms, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, SES
- **Frontend Monitoring**: testing framework for building functional tests against Reuters News website
  - *Code*: Python using Selenium Webdriver, urllib.request, boto3 with S3, SES, and Canary clients
  - *Infrastructure*: CloudWatch Synthetics Canary, EventBridge, Alarms, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, SES
- **Treatment**: video rendering and audio normalization. The pipeline is triggered by S3 event, processing files and moving them through buckets
  - *Code*: Python using urllib.request, boto3 with S3 client, stefuna, subprocess
  - *Infrastructure*: S3 Event, Lambda, Step Function, Step Function Activity, S3
- **DNS Rebalancer**: CLI-based application to manage DNS records, it can be used to redirect traffic of applications between regions during blue-green deployment
  - *Code*: Python using boto3 with Route53 client
  - *Infrastructure*: Docker, Jenkins Pipeline
- **Github Bulk**: CLI-based app to manage permissions of repositories by groups and users
  - *Code*: Python using PyGithub, diskcache
  - *Infrastructure*: Docker, Jenkins Pipeline
- **Rotate JWT**: Lambda for rotation of RSA-keys in SecretManager
  - *Code*: Python using cryptography, boto3 with Secret Manager client
  - *Infrastructure*: RDS, SNS, Lambda
- **RDS Watcher**: Lambda for pointing of DNS-records to active endpoint of RDS cluster
  - *Code*: Python using boto3 with RDS, Route53 clients
  - *Infrastructure*: Lambda, RDS
- **Bulk Object Sync**: synchronization tool for deploying of configuration to services by API request sending
  - *Code*: Python using requests, csv; Groovy
  - *Infrastructure*: Docker, Jenkins Pipeline
- **Roxy Proxy**: reverse proxy that is capable of applying regular expressions on backend responses
  - *Code*: Python using Aiohttp
  - *Infrastructure*: EFS, ECS, ECS, ALB, Route53
- **Grafana and InfluxDB stack**: visualization and analytics for performance testing
  - *Infrastructure*: EFS, ECS, ECS, ALB, Route53
- **JAR Bootstrapper**: a script that serves as a docker-entrypoint for running applications. It compiles configuration files, runs an application in background, listens OS-signals and responds to them specifically
  - *Code*: Python using os, subprocess, signal, jsonmerge, boto3 with clients SSM, Secret Manager
  - *Infrastructure*: Docker
- **EventSink**: server-side web API application that receives various kinds of infrastructure events and handles them in a customizable way
  - *Code*: Python using FastAPI, Pydantic, Aiodynamo
  - *Infrastructure*: DynamoDB, ECS, ALB, Route53
