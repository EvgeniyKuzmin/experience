At the start of the project my main responsibility was migration of backend API service (Sope) to a new infrastructure. Then I continued working as a part of DevOps team to deliver Python based solution to solve infrastructure issues. I was involved in developing of different services, starting from writing of Python code to describing infrastructure by IaaC and building CI/CD. There is the list of services I was working on:

- Sope: API-service for program composition and personalization by applying of trained Gensim/Sklearn models, it is based on Pyramid framework, uses SQLAlchemy and Redis
- Frontend Monitoring: testing framework with a bunch of functional tests based on AWS Synthetics Canary platform, using Python and Selenium against Reuters News website
- Treatment: Step Function for video rendering and normalizing audio. Pipeline is triggered by S3 event, processing files and moving them through buckets
- DNS Rebalancer: CLI-based app to handle AWS Route53 DNS records, it can be used to redirect traffic of applications between several policies and servers
- Github Bulk: CLI-based app to manage permissions of repositories by groups and users
- Rotate JWT: Lambda for rotation of RSA-keys in SecretManager
